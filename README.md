Engine
======
The game runs on a modified version of the [Dedalus](https://github.com/pistacchio/Dedalus) engine. One of the big differences is that the story is not contained within the index file. The story can be accessed in the data folder as story.dat. This is just a HTML file that gets loaded into the story div using javascript.
